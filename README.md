# Minimal Component Kit Demo
This project is a stripped down starting place for learning Facebook's [ComponentKit](https://github.com/facebook/componentkit). It provides a single `ViewController` which demonstrates hooking up a data source, inserting model objects, and creating some basic components to display those models in a `UICollectionView`.

### Development
AKSComponentDemo uses Cocoapods.
`pod install` then run the main app scheme in `AKSComponentDemo.xcworkspace`.
